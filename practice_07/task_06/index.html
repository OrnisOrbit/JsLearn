         an obscure iPhone game and an app that let people put Donald Trump’s distinctive 
         yellow hair on their own photos.

Then Mr. Ton-That — an Australian techie and onetime model — did something momentous: 
He invented a tool that could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously, 
and provided it to hundreds of law enforcement agencies, ranging from local cops in Florida to 
the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security.

His tiny company, Clearview AI, devised a groundbreaking facial recognition app. 
You take a picture of a person, upload it and get to see public photos of that person, 
along with links to where those photos appeared. The system — whose backbone is a database 
of more than three billion images that Clearview claims to have scraped from Facebook, 
YouTube, Venmo and millions of other websites — goes far beyond anything ever constructed 
by the United States government or Silicon Valley giants.`.toLowerCase();
